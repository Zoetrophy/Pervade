Summary: An introverted teenage girl with an unconventional superpower, Taylor goes out in
costume to find escape from a deeply unhappy and frustrated civilian life. Her first attempt
at taking down a supervillain sees her mistaken for one, thrusting her into the midst of the
local ‘cape’ scene’s politics, unwritten rules, and ambiguous morals. As she risks life and
limb, Taylor faces the dilemma of having to do the wrong things for the right reasons.
